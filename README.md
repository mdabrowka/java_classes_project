# java_classes_project
In this project I explored Object Oriented Programming in Java by creating models simulating a restaurant management system. 
I used class diagrams as a means to plan relationships between different components. 
I used Test Driven Development to determine and validate class methods. 
The project allowed me to explore SOLID principles, particularly Dependency Inversion.
